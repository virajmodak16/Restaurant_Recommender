# Restaurant Recommender - PLEASE READ BEFORE PROCEEDING #

All the the relevant coding files and reports are in this particular repository. Please read this file before proceeding to understand the project flow and the aspects discussed in each relevant file.

### Objective ###
In this project I have developed a restaurant recommender system. Multiple approaches have been tried including:
1. Hybrid model with K-Means clustering and Content-based filtering
2. User-Item and User-User collaborative filtering

### Raw Data Location ###
The raw data can be found at the following location and will not be included in the repository owing to the size:

### EDA/Statistical Analysis ###
Please follow the following IPython notebooks for information on preliminary data cleanup EDA and statistical analysis:

### Machine Learning ###
Multiple strategies were implemented to build the recommender system. They are presented in the form of two IPython notebooks listed below:
Hybrid(Content+Clustering).ipynb
Collaborative-Filtering.ipynb

### Milestone Report 2 ###
The second milestone report which includes description on the the strategies used to build the recommender systems are included in the form of a PDF document:
